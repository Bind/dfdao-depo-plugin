Anyone can deposit into the Depo by simply calling the ERC721 contract and transfering their NFT to the Depo address or by clicking the "Deposit Me" button.

Whitelisted users (Captains) can withdraw artifacts from the Depo.

Super Users (MastersAtArms) can add or remove addresses to the captains (and MAA) list.
